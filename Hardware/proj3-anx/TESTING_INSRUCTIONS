TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:

To run the tests we provided you, type './run_sanity_check.sh' from your project folder.
This will copy your alu.circ and regfile.circ into the 'tests' folder and then run the tests.

To see what happened during a test, you can go to tests and open the .circ files.
These are harnesses that are modified to have testing inputs in them. 
You can tick the clock and see the outputs of your ALU, and compare them to what you would expect.

To make your own tests, type 'python alu_test_creator.py' from your project folder.
This will output a .X, .Y, .S, and .out files in your 'tests' folder.
Open your alu harness, and save it under a new name. 
Right-click on each memory element and click "Load Image...", and then select the appropriate file.
Load your .X file into the first, your .Y file into the second, and your .S file into the 3rd.
You can now step through your test interactively and see the output.

To run your test in an automated fashion, copy the last line outputted by the test-creator and paste
it into the file called tests/sanity_test.py in the list called 'tests' at the bottom of the file. 
You have now added your test to the staff tests! If you run the sanity check again, your test will now be run as well!
