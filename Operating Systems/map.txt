1. The main and recur addresses are defined in the .text segment.  The rest
   are assigned at runtime and are not found in the executable.
2. the .init section arranges the code to be executed, the .plt is a linkage
   table created so the linker can find external functions to make sense of 
   some functions not defined in the executable, the .text section stores the
   executable instructions for the program, and the .fini section terminates
   the code.
3. The stack is growing downward.
4. Each stack call is 48 bits or 6 bytes from the next.
5. The heap starts at 0x1715010 with buf1's malloc and is growing up.
6. I believe that the memory areas are not contiguous because the first malloc
   ends at 100 bits from its start which is not divisible by 8 so the second
   malloc starts at 105, leaving 101-104 empty.
