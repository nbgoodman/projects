1. The value of argv is the address 0x7fffffffe688.
2. argv points to an array of strings, which themselves
   are just character array pointers.  argv[0] shows the 
   address to the string "/home/vagrant/code/personal/hw0/wctest3"
   which is where the executable is stored.  arg[1] shows the 
   address to the string "testtext2.txt" which is the text file
   that was passed into the program.
3. The address of the function main is 0x4007bd. I got this by
   using info symbol from my breakpoint and subtracting until I
   got the right address.
4. I see the function I am in (main) along with the arguments passed
   in (argc=2, argv=0x7fffffffe688) and the line I am at in execution
   (at wc.c:39)
5. I see the rip which is a windows version of a program counter, so
   it is pointing to the address of the next instruction to be run.  I 
   see the stack level 0 which is the same as rbp which is the address 
   of bottom of the stack.  I see the arglist which has the arguments
   that were passed in to the main function.  I also see locals pointing
   at the same arguments as arglist.  I see the previous frame's sp which
   is the same as the current frame since there is only one frame needed for
   the code.  Finally I see the saved registers, which in this case is the
   address of the bottom of the frame and the address of the rip register.
6. The rip register is holding the next instruction to be run.  The rbp
   register is holding the address of the bottom of the stack.
